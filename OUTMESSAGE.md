This code was written entirely by the following group members: Azeb Mihiretie, Esubalew Chekol, Hayat Ebrahim, Lidiya Fikrie, and Bereket Gebeyaw. All content, except for some methods, was created using our own knowledge, and no information was copied from any internet or external sources. To verify this, one can search any content of this code on any search engine to confirm that it is not copied.

Although we tried our best to create a perfect inverted index, this code may not reflect the ideal result as we had a limited period of time to work on it.

To create this code, we utilized resources from the internet to learn about natural language toolkit (nltk) and panda, specifically from the websites of Python.org, Medium.com, and GeeksForGeeks.com. We also defined several functions, including TOKENIZER(), STOPWORDREMOVER(), STEMMER() using PorterStemmer, and TF CALCULATOR() using Panda functions.

The code consists of two main parts: function definition and main method. The main method contains codes that interact with the user and perform the necessary tasks.

In summary, this code serves as a product of our collective effort and learning, and we hope it will prove useful to those who use it. Thank you.
